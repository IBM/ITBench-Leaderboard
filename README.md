# ITBench-Leaderboard

> üîó Looking for the public leaderboard? [Click here to view it](https://github.com/IBM/ITBench-Leaderboard/LEADERBOARD.md)

Measure the performance of your AI agent(s) across a wide variety of complex and real-life IT automation tasks targetting three key use cases:
- Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) - focusing on availability and resiliency
- Financial Operations (FinOps) - focusing on enforcing cost efficiencies and optimizing return on investment
- Compliance and Security Operations (CISO) - focusing on ensuring compliance and security of IT implementations

This is a public leaderboard. ITBench handles the deployment of the environments, scenarios and evaluates the submissions made by the agent.

## Key Terminologies
- **Scenario**: ITBench incorporates a collection of problems that we call scenarios. For example, one of the SRE scenarios in ITBench is to resolve a ‚ÄúHigh error rate on service checkout‚Äù in a Kubernetes environment. Another scenario that is relevant for the CISO use case involves assessing the compliance posture for a ‚Äúnew control rule detected for RHEL 9.‚Äù
- **Environment**: Each of the ITBench scenarios are deployed in an operational sandboxed Kubernetes environment.
- **Benchmark**: Collection of scenarios that are excuted parallel or in sequence but independent of each other. An agent makes a submission to address or diagnose or remediate the scenario at hand.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- **A private GitHub repository**
  - A file facilitating the agent and leaderboard handshake is committed to this private repository.
  - File(s) may be created or deleted automatically during the benchmark lifecycle.
- **A Kubernetes sandbox cluster (KinD recommended)** -- Only needed for CISO 
  - Do not use a production cluster as the benchmark process will create and delete resources dynamically.
  - Please refer to [prepare-kubeconfig-kind.md](https://github.com/IBM/ITBench-Scenarios/blob/main/ciso/prepare-kubeconfig-kind.md)
- **An agent to benchmark**
  - A base agent is available from IBM for immediate use. The base agent for the CISO use-case can be found [here](https://github.com/IBM/itbench-ciso-caa-agent) and one for SRE and FinOps use cases can be found [here]. This allows you to leverage your methodologies / improvements without having to worry about the agent and leaderboard setvice interactions

### Setup
1. Install the ITBench GitHub App to the private GitHub repository
    - Click [here](https://github.com/apps/ibm-itbench-github-app) and install the ITBench GitHub app to the private repository

### Running your agent or our base agent against the benchmark
- A guide to evaluate our CISO base agent against the ITBench Leaderboard can be found [here](docs/instruction-for-agent-submitter-ciso.md#step-3-launch-benchmark).
- A guide to evaluate our SRE base agent against the ITBench Leaderboard can be found [here](https://github.com/IBM/ITBench-SRE-Agent/blob/leaderboard_updates/Leaderboard.md).
